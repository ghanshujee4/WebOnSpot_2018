If the threshold is breached on the lower or on the higher side by&nbsp;5%, then the premium rates will be increased/decreased by 3%.

If on 30.9.16, if the rate goes up to Rs.75, then the increase is 7% which will call for a 3% increase in the rates wef 1.10.16. If on 31.12.16, if the rate goes down to Rs.64, then rates will revert to their original position which is a 3% decrease from the current rate. If on 31.3.17, the rate goes down further to Rs. 56, which is&nbsp;8% decrease from the lower range threshold of Rs. 61, there will be a 3% decrease in prices.</li>

If on 30.9.16, if the rate goes up to Rs.75, then the increase is 7% which will call for a 3% increase in the rates wef 1.10.16. If on 31.12.16, if the rate goes down to Rs.64, then rates will revert to their original position which is a 3% decrease from the current rate.
